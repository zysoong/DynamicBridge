Wouldn't it be cool if you could automatically change into your swimsuit when you're swimming in the Ruby Sea? 
Or automatically put on a winter coat when you're going to a snowy place? With DynamicBridge, this is now possible! You can set your customization settings to automatically apply to new presets based on various rules YOU choose! Time of day, weather, biomes, in game zones, job, even emotes! You can even register your in game house so you can automatically change into a cozy glam upon entering your abode.

## FAQ

- How do I set rule priority?
	- Rules are applied from the top down. 
	For example, the following rules would be listed in this order:
	1) "If I am in water, put on my swimsuit" 
	2) "If I am in a tropical biome, put on X"

	This way, when I go into the water it will put on my swimsuit and when I come out (if i am in a tropical area) it will put on my tropical outfit.
